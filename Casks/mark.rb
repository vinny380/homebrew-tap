  caveats <<~EOS
    Mark isn't notarized by Apple yet. The first time you open it, go to
    System Settings → Privacy & Security and click "Open Anyway".

    To get "New Markdown File" in Finder's right-click menu, open Mark once, then
    turn it on in System Settings → General → Login Items & Extensions.
